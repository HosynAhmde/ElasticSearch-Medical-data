It can be idiopathic or associated with well-known etiologies. Gastric outlet obstruction can progressively inflate the stomach and cause pneumatosis. Regarding abdominal signs and the presence of acute abdomen, management varies from just conservative to emergent surgical interventions. CASE PRESENTATION: We introduce an adult patient who presented to our hospital with weakness and dyspnea. After initial measures, unexpectedly we found intraabdominal free gas, concurrent gastric pneumatosis, and aeroportia. Due to the absence of positive abdominal signs, the patient was treated successfully without any surgical or endoscopic interventions. DISCUSSION: Gastric outlet obstruction is a well-known cause of gastric pneumatosis. Progressive dilation of the stomach due to pyloric stenosis is well-described both in infants and adult populations. CONCLUSION: In stable patients, gastric drainage and correction of electrolyte disturbance are the only required treatment. However endoscopic and surgical interventions should be considered in unstable patients or those developing acute abdomen."	�Aeroportia; Gastric emphysema; Gastric outlet obstruction; Gastric pneumatosis; Pneumoperitoneum		2021	10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.106584

Preventative measures for loss, careful removal during the initial surgery, and good documentation of any concern for remaining intraperitoneal stones needs to be performed with the initial surgery. CASE REPORT: An 80-year-old male with a history of complicated biliary disease resulting in a cholecystectomy presented to general surgery clinic with increasing symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. CT imaging was concerning for a malignant process despite negative biopsies. A distal gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction was performed and final pathology showed dense inflammation with a single calcified stone incarcerated within the gastric wall of the inflamed pylorus and no malignancy. DISCUSSION: Stones lost during laparoscopic cholecystectomy are not innocuous and preventative measures for loss, careful removal during the initial surgery, and good documentation of any concern for remaining intraperitoneal stones. CONCLUSION: This is the first case of gastric outlet obstruction caused by an intramural obstruction of the pylorus from a spilled gallstone during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and subsequent inflammation. This is an etiology that must be considered in new cases of gastric outlet obstruction and can mimic malignancy."	�Case report; Gastric outlet obstruction; Laparoscopic cholecystectomy; Lost gallstones.		2017	10.1016/j.ijscr.2017.10.014

Aneurysms larger than 5 cm are referred to as giant visceral artery aneurysms (GVAA). We present a case of a celiac artery aneurysm of 14 cm which required endovascular and surgical management. A review of the literature with focus on treatment is also provided. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report, a 76-year-old male presented with postprandial nausea and vomitus. An ultrasound and computed tomography scan showed an aneurysm of the celiac artery of approximately 14 cm. Initial treatment was conducted with coiling. Despite this treatment, patient presented again with the same complaints, most likely due to gastric outlet syndrome caused by the aneurysm sac. Partial open removal of the aneurysm sac was performed with release of the duodenum. Due to recurring dysphagia and postprandial nausea, a gastroenterostomy was created, which was later supplemented with a Roux-en-Y anastomosis due to gastroparesis. Patient recovered uneventful after the Roux-en-Y and was discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSION: Giant visceral artery aneurysms sometimes need multimodal treatment. We showed that an endovascular first approach of a giant visceral artery aneurysm is not only technically feasible, but it also facilitates subsequent open surgery due to limiting blood loss and reducing the need for extensive mobilisation of the viscera to gain arterial control."	�Celiac artery aneurysm; embolization; gastric outlet obstruction; giant; visceral artery aneurysm.		2022	10.1080/00015458.2021.2024963

The condition is predominately found in females and can be associated with trichotillomania, or the compulsive urge to pull one's own hair out. There are less than 40 cases described in the literature with the prevention of recurrence aimed at psychological treatment. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient is a 7 year-old girl with a history of trichotillomania with trichophagia as a young child who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, consistent with a gastric outlet obstruction. She had an exploratory laparotomy with gastrostomy performed revealing a 18cm by 18cm trichobezoar with extension into the small bowel. DISCUSSION: Bezoars, an already rare entity, can occasionally lead to gastric and small bowel obstructions. Small collections of ingested hair build up in the intestinal tract causing significant symptoms. These obstructions can sometimes be treated through minimally invasive techniques but, in our case described, it is unlikely to have been treated any other way due to the substantial size of the trichobezoar. CONCLUSION: Early consideration of Rapunzel syndrome is important in young females presenting with a gastric outlet obstruction."	�Case report; Gastric mass; Laparotomy; Rapunzel syndrome; Trichobezoar; Trichotillomania		2017	10.1016/j.ijscr.2017.03.011

Those patients presenting with acute complications of parastomal hernias typically undergo surgical repair. Stomach-containing parastomal hernias are rare. Presentation of case A 92-year-old lady presented to the emergency department with vomiting and abdominal pain. She had undergone a total colectomy with end-ileostomy many years earlier. A computed tomography scan of her abdomen diagnosed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to parastomal stomach herniation. The obstruction resolved with simple nasogastric decompression and the patient did not receive surgery. She was discharged from hospital after two days. Discussion Gastric outlet obstruction secondary to a parastomal hernia is rare. A systematic literature search found 12 previously reported cases. This is the first case managed without invasive procedures. Conclusion For gastric outlet obstruction caused by parastomal herniation, surgeons should consider non-operative management with nasogastric decompression when the patient in question is frail and a poor surgical candidate."

The transabdominal laparoscopic approach is the well-established repair form for giant hiatal hernia. To our best knowledge, reports on post-operative gastric outlet obstruction of giant hiatal hernia repair have been scanty up till now. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old female patient was referred to the Emergency Department of our hospital with a chief complaint of acute right epigastric pain for 2 days. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness in the right epigastrium, without rebound tenderness or guarding. The abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a large low-density gastric artifact in the lower mediastinum-giant hiatal hernia. The barium swallow esophagogram and gastroscopy also confirmed the presence of a giant hiatal hernia. A transabdominal laparoscopic operation for reduction of the hernia contents and repair of the hiatal defect was performed. Her right epigastric pain alleviated obviously on the first postoperative day. On post-operative day five, however, she was presented with nausea and vomiting independent of meals. The nasogastric tube was inserted and kept in the stomach for 7 days. After removing the nasogastric tube, severe nausea and vomiting of the patient occurred again. Barium swallow revealed gastroptosis and enfoldment in the duodenal bulb, which indicated the presence of gastric outlet obstruction. Gastrojejunostomy was performed for her to relieve the gastric outlet obstruction. The patient was discharged on the tenth day after the second operation without any discomfort. During the regular follow-up period, she felt well and was satisfied with her status. CONCLUSIONS: Facing the giant hiatal hernia repair, the reduction of the hernia contents and repair of the hiatal defect being well operated on are insufficient, and we must watch out the anatomical variation, like the deviation of partial intra-abdominal organs from their normal positions, as well as paying attention to the protection of abdominal vagal nerve during the operation. Post-operative gastric outlet obstruction of giant hiatal hernia repair is rare, while gastrojejunostomy can successfully relieve the gastric outlet obstruction."	�Case report; Complications; Giant hiatal hernia; Laparoscopy; Surgery.

There are different types of bezoars, named according to the material they are made of. These include phytobezoar, lactobezoar, pharmacobezoar, trichobezoar, and polybezoar. Trichobezoars (hair ball) are usually located in the stomach but may extend through the pylorus into the duodenum and small bowel (Rapunzel syndrome). CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of a young adult female known to have a long-standing trichophagia who presented with gastric outlet obstruction due to a large trichobezoar. Endoscopy revealed a large and hard gastric trichobezoar not amenable to endoscopic retrieval leading to surgical extraction as a last resort. DISCUSSION: They are almost always associated with trichotillomania and trichophagia or other psychiatric disorders. Trichobezoar can be treated either surgically by laparotomy/laparoscopy or by endoscopic intervention. CONCLUSION: Treatment should be coupled to psychiatric evaluation and therapy to prevent recurrence."	�Bezoars; Case report; Gastric outlet obstruction; Pica disorder.		2019	10.1016/j.ijscr.2019.04.002

We herein present the case of a 68-year-old woman who was admitted to our department with nausea and appetite loss. The patient's medical history included right mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy 5 years earlier for invasive lobular carcinoma, measuring 6.2 cm in greatest diameter, without lymphovascular invasion. Two years after the surgery, the patient developed brain metastasis and underwent metastasectomy to control the neurological symptoms, including unsteadiness and asthenia. After the second surgery, the patient received systemic chemotherapy using S-1, followed by bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. However, due to bevacizumab-related cardiotoxicity, the treatment was switched to eribulin. On esophagogastroduodenoscopy, an elevated lesion was identified in the antrum, causing severe narrowing of the gastric outlet. Biopsy and histological examination of the tumor revealed infiltration of the gastric wall by undifferentiated neoplastic cells with poor adhesion, morphologically similar to invasive lobular carcinoma, and immunohistochemical staining was positive for estrogen receptor, mammaglobin and GATA3. Finally, (18)F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography imaging revealed FDG uptake across the thickness of the antral wall. The patient was diagnosed with gastric metastasis from the original breast cancer and subsequently underwent endoscopic self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement. There were no procedure-related adverse events, and the patient remained alive under best supportive care 4 months after SEMS placement.

Sudan has high burden of tuberculosis (TB) with a prevalence of 209 cases per 100,000 of the population and it is commonly presented with pulmonary disease but involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is not uncommon. Abdominal tuberculosis comprises about 1-3 % of all cases of tuberculosis and about 12% of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. It involves the ileocecal region, but involvement of stomach and duodenum are rare sites. Here we present an unusual case of gastric outlet obstruction due to gastric tuberculosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old Sudanese man presented with a non-bile stain persistent projectile vomiting, and epigastric pain for two years associated with marked loss of weight. There is no fever or cough. He was on antacid, physical examination showed BMI 18 and stable vital signs. He was not pale or jaundiced, there was no cervical lymphadenopathy and chest was clear. Abdominal examination was normal apart of positive succussion splash. The results of haematological tests were normal, ESR was 30 mm/hr, hepatitis B, C and HIV were negative. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed that the stomach was full of fluid and food particles and ulcerated mass in the pylorus extended to the proximal part of the duodenum with severe narrowing of the pylorus. The lesion biopsied and the result revealed active inflammatory cells, cryptitis and multiple lymphoid follicles, no malignancy seen. Sonographic test showed hypodense pyloric mass, enlarged para-aortic and mesenteric lymph nodes and mild pelvic ascites. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed antral hypodense lesions multiple mesenteric lymphadenopathies peritoneal thickening and ascites. Chest X-ray was normal. Intra-operative findings were dilated stomach and pylorus mass with multiple mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal and omental seedlings all over with small nodules on the surface of the liver, gastro-jejunostomy was done. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis. Postoperative event was uneventful. Patient received anti-tuberculous. CONCLUSIONS: Here we presented an unusual case of gastric outlet obstruction due to primary gastric tuberculosis, patient underwent surgery to relief his symptoms and received anti-tuberculous."

Narrow-band imaging (NBI) endoscopy showed a polypoid tumor with normal coverage mucosa prolapsing through the pylorus. The tumor was surgically removed. Histopathological (HP) examination revealed the presence of spindle cells with uniform nuclei exhibiting no mitotic activity. The inflammatory cells were predominantly represented by eosinophils. The vascular component was prominent suggesting a vascular lesion. We put emphasis on the presentation of this particular case because of its scarcity among the other types of gastric polyps, suspicion for features of malignancy, and the particularities of the clinical presentation, consisting of intermittent gastric outlet obstruction (""ball valve syndrome"") accompanied by weight loss and anemia.

Ann Med Surg (Lond)	Annals of medicine and surgery (2012)	2049-0801 (Print) 2049-0801 (Linking)	England	"Introduction: Peptic ulcer disease has significantly decreased over the past several decades making the need for definitive surgical intervention an infrequent occurrence. Presentation of Case: A 44-year-old Caucasian female was sent to the emergency department by her primary care physician for right upper quadrant abdominal pain which had been intermittent for the past two months but acutely worsened over the last five days. During this time, she was unable to tolerate oral intake with intractable nausea and vomiting. Upper GI endoscopy revealed a tight stricture in the second part of the duodenum and antral biopsy was Helicobacter pylori negative. Patient underwent two rounds of balloon dilation with short lived symptomatic relief. An open pylorus-preserving duodenal stricturoplasty using a Heineke-Mikulicz technique was then performed. The operation was successful and the patient has had no reoccurrence of her symptoms. Discussion: Gastric outlet obstruction is an uncommon complication of peptic ulcer disease in respect to chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. The unique location of the patient's stricture and her desire to minimize post-operative GI alterations demanded a review of surgical options and identified the benefits of maintaining the patient's original anatomy versus choosing an extra-anatomic approach. Conclusion: This case presented a unique challenge and demonstrated the need for definitive surgical interventions in the treatment of peptic ulcer induced gastric outlet obstruction. This case adds support for the direct anatomic treatment of duodenal strictures when conservative measures fail and perhaps promotes further development of laparoscopic management of gastric outlet obstruction in the future."	�Duodenum; Gastric outlet obstruction; Peptic ulcer disease; Stricture; Stricturoplasty.		2018	10.1016/j.amsu.2018.03.017

It is an odd cause of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). The aim of this study is to present and discuss a case of GOO caused by multiple giant bezoars. CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old female, presented with abdominal pain and vomiting (non-bilious) with negative past history. Examination and investigations revealed multiple giant bezoars requiring emergent surgical intervention. An exploratory laparotomy was conducted. Two giant bezoars were palpated in the stomach and removed through an anterior gastrotomy. DISCUSSION: Bezoars are regarded as rare benign causes of GOO. Bezoars can present with vomiting, nausea, and/or symptoms of GOO. Predisposing risk factors include delayed gastric emptying (as in case of diabetic mellitus) vagotomy, partial gastrectomy pyloroplasty, peptic ulcer disease, chronic gastritis, Crohn's disease, and carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. The current case had phytobezoar without any known risk factor. CONCLUSION: GOO caused by phytobezoar can occur in patients without history of previous gastric surgery or diabetes mellitus.

Herein, we report a case of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to metastatic lobular breast carcinoma. CASE PRESENTATION: Fifty-seven year old Caucasian female with recently diagnosed metastatic lobular breast carcinoma to skin was referred to gastroenterology for evaluation of dyspepsia and dysphagia. She has past medical history significant for acid reflux and Clostridium difficile colitis. Computed tomography of her abdomen showed diffused bowel wall thickening without evidence of bowel obstruction. Due to persistent abdominal pain, an upper endoscopy was performed. The upper endoscopy showed gastritis and gastric stenosis in the gastric antrum. These lesions were biopsied and dilated with a balloon dilator. The biopsy of the gastric antrum later showed a metastatic carcinoma of breast origin with typical tumor morphology and immune-phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiating metastatic breast carcinoma from primary gastric adenocarcinoma cannot be done using histological examination alone. Immunohistochemistry is needed to differentiate the two based on staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors. The presence of gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 is also suggestive of metastatic breast carcinoma. The stomach has a significant capacity to distend (up to 2-4 L of food) and malignant gastric outlet obstruction is often undetected clinically until a high-grade obstruction develops. Our case demonstrates valuable teaching point in terms of broadening our differentials for gastric outlet obstruction. When patients present with gastric outlet obstruction, both non-malignant and malignant causes of gastric outlet obstruction should be considered. Once adenocarcinoma has been determined to be the cause of gastric outlet obstruction, further immunohistochemistry is needed to differentiate breast carcinoma from other carcinomas."

Surgery done to extract two impacted large gallstone of 2x2x1 and 6x3.5x3cm followed by cholecystectomy, closure of fistulae, gastrojejunsotomy and vagotomy. DISCUSSION: Bouveret Syndrome is referred to as rare presentation of gastric outlet obstruction by passage of large gallstone through a fistula between the gallbladder and proximal gastrointestinal tract. It has a vague presentation, and can be misdiagnosed due to non-specific symptoms. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a CT scan and it is treated surgically most of the time.

Computed tomography of abdomen showed signs of small bowel obstruction associated with segmental small bowel ischaemic changes. Postoperatively, patient developed an intolerance to oral intake with upper gastrointestinal scope showing sever stricture at the distal gastric lumen and pylorus. The patient was taken to the operation where gastrojejunostomy and brown procedure was done. Corrosive gastric injury treatment depends on the degree of gastric involvement, related oesophageal strictures and the patient's general health. Early surgery offers very satisfactory and physiological results, whereas avoiding gastric resection or bypass provides very satisfactory and physiological outcomes."			2021	10.1093/jscr/rjab027

We herein present a case of a young adult female with upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. She underwent upper GI endoscopy twice, which revealed pyloric narrowing and intramural mass. Gastric endoscopic mucosal biopsies were performed, but no tumor was identified and her symptoms persisted. Imaging studies also revealed a mass lesion. Open laparotomy and partial gastrectomy with histopathology of the resected specimen revealed the true nature of the lesion. Surgery also improved her symptoms.

Appropriate hormone replacement therapy is the cornerstone of its management and is typically in the form of oral preparations of levothyroxine. Intravenous replacement is a well-known alternative in patients who are unable to take medication orally for long periods. However, effective and safe alternatives to oral preparations of levothyroxine should be sought in the absence of the parenteral alternative. The aim of this report is to describe an alternative route for levothyroxine supplementation when the oral and parenteral routes are not available. CASE REPORT This study reports a hypothyroid patient with symptomatic malignant gastric outlet obstruction requiring surgery. However, the patient's surgical condition precluded oral administration of levothyroxine and the parenteral alternative was unavailable. Hormone replacement therapy was administered rectally in the form of enemas in preparing the patient for surgery. CONCLUSIONS Rectal administration of levothyroxine using enemas can be a safe and effective alternative for patients in whom administration via the oral route is not feasible, especially when parenteral formulas are unavailable."

Gastric Outlet Obstruction is the least frequent complication of Peptic Ulcer disease. CASE SUMMARY: In this report, we present a case of massive gastric dilation due to gastric outlet obstruction, that needed emergency surgery due to perforation. A subtotal gastrectomy with a Billroth II reconstruction was performed. DISCUSSION: Usually non-operative management is tried first, with medical therapy and endoscopic dilation. Emergent surgery is rarely needed, but in this patient, despite trying to optimize his condition first, the ulcer perforation precipitated surgical management. CONCLUSION: Although Gastric Outlet Obstruction is the least frequent complication of Peptic Ulcer Disease and usually non-operative treatment is tried first, surgery may be necessary."

In adults, the most common condition relates to herniations through a weakened crural orifice via which the oesophagus normally traverses. These hiatus hernias are classified as types I-IV depending on the extent of visceral involvement. CASE REPORT: We present here a case of type IV hiatus hernia with massive mediastinal herniation of the small bowel, yet remarkable in that the stomach itself remained completely intra-abdominal. Gastric outlet obstruction occurred as a consequence of extrinsic proximal small bowel compression.
